Then findging the area of the space created using those two blocaks first. Note - distance is nothing but the difference of the index values of the two elements in list \"heights\". Now, we need to change on of the pointers, thinking that \"length\" (gap betweek the index of elements in heights list) and \"height\" both are maximised. So lets say we move \"i\" to \"i+1\", since now the value of the element in heights list is bigger than previous one, and gap between its index and the element at \"j\"th place is just decreasing by 1. So we can think like this... (see solution below)\n",

For example, if the left line is shorter, we know that moving the right pointer inward won’t help (since the height is limited by the shorter line), so in that case moving the left line is helpful with the hope that we get a higher height in left value.\n",
